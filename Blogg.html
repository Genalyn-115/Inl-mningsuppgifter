        <h2>Live From Your Heart</h2>
        <p>Living from your heart means that you choose a life and a lifestyle that are true for you and your family. It
            means you
            make important decisions because they resonate with your heart and your own values, and not necessarily with
            those of
            others. Living from your heart means that you trust your own instincts more than the pressures from
            advertising or the
            expectations of society, neighbors and friends.
            Living from your heart, however does not mean you become a rebel, break family tradition or become different
            from
            everyone else. It’s far more subtle than that. Living from the heart is about trusting that quiet voice
            within you that
            emerges when you quiet down enough to listen. It’s that voice that speaks to you from a place of wisdom and
            common sense
            instead of from frantic chatter of habit. When you trust your heart rather than your habits, new insights
            will pop into
            your mind. These insights can be the realization of the necessity to break a destructive habit, to an answer
            of how you
            communicate differently with someone you love. You might also have insights about who you choose to spend
            time as well
            as new ways to solve problems. It all starts from listening to your heart.</p>
